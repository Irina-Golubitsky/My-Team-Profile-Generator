Generated page displays basic info about team Manager including manager’s name, manager's ID, email address, and office number; info about each Engineer - engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username; Intern's info - intern’s name, ID, email, and school. When you  click on an email address in the HTML, your default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
